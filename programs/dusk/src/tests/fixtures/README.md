# hLP entry regression snapshot

`hlp-entry-devnet-500291305.bin` is the public Market account returned by an unsigned `preview_market` simulation at Solana devnet slot 500291305 for `7Rjrf8i81hZihsuFdPfzTaP6SiQ3JEmQs7Hfg7YNjkNm` (META/USDC). The reviewed program source was `1fa72d35973efedd47a157775cdd0d1ef3ae90d9`, deployed at slot 499930981. The file includes Anchor's account discriminator and contains no wallet keys.

The real META vault has 10,000,000 live shares and an actionable hedge (entry blocked); the USDC vault has no shares and admits entry. Tests replay the same accrued slot, then assert native admission and exact funding boundaries. This fixture is not production configuration or a source of current market values.
