# hLP entry regression snapshot

`hlp-entry-devnet-500291305.bin` is the public Market account returned by an unsigned `preview_market` simulation at Solana devnet slot 500291305 for `7Rjrf8i81hZihsuFdPfzTaP6SiQ3JEmQs7Hfg7YNjkNm` (META/USDC). The reviewed program source was `1fa72d35973efedd47a157775cdd0d1ef3ae90d9`, deployed at slot 499930981. The file includes Anchor's account discriminator and contains no wallet keys.

The real META vault has 10,000,000 live shares and an actionable hedge (entry blocked); the USDC vault has no shares and admits entry. Tests replay the same accrued slot, then assert native admission and exact funding boundaries. This fixture is not production configuration or a source of current market values.

## VOB swap rounding regression snapshot

`vob-market-20260929.bin` and `vob-authority-20260929.bin` are public devnet Market and FutarchyAuthority account bytes captured at slot 505496119 for market `45qXCmfQrDxTDYc1k7Xu65Qo3kYHRYUkYmiCQKLvPBhL` (META/USDC). The block timestamp was 1790677156. They contain no private keys. Tests use this fixed state and timestamp to replay the twelve bid levels that exposed the fractional-output rounding carry, plus the opposite swap direction and an unexplained reserve-drift rejection. These fixtures are regression inputs, not current market data.

The captured Market predates the two fractional debt-index carry fields. The
benchmark tests insert zero carry bytes at those fields when decoding this
historical snapshot; the fixture file itself retains the original account bytes.
